Create a Servicenow Script Include that can effectively parse JSON responses from any API call. The script should:
Accept a JSON string as input.
Utilize robust JSON parsing methods to extract data efficiently and accurately.
Handle potential parsing errors gracefully, such as invalid JSON formats or missing data.
Return a structured data object (e.g., GlideRecord, JavaScript object) for easy manipulation and further processing within Servicenow.
Provide flexibility to handle various JSON structures and data types.

Example Usage:
var jsonString = '{"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}';
var parsedData = new JSONParser().parse(jsonString);
gs.info(parsedData.name); // Output: John Doe

Additional Considerations:

Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to catch exceptions and provide informative messages.
Data Validation: Consider adding data validation logic to ensure the parsed data meets specific criteria.
Performance Optimization: For large JSON responses, optimize parsing performance using techniques like streaming or asynchronous processing.
Security: If dealing with sensitive data, ensure proper security measures are in place to protect against vulnerabilities.
