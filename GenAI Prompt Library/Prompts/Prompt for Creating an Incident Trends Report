### Prompt for Creating an Incident Trends Report

**Prompt:** Develop a report that analyzes incident trends over the last quarter. The report should focus on the following aspects:
- Distribution of incidents by priority level (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- Average resolution times for incidents by priority level.
- Identification of any trends or patterns in incident resolution.

**Structure:** Outline the steps required to gather the necessary data, analyze it, and present the findings in a visually appealing report format.

### Expected Output:

1. **Define Report Scope:**
   - Timeframe: Last quarter (e.g., July 1 - September 30).
   - Data points to analyze:
     - Number of incidents by priority level.
     - Average resolution time by priority level.
     - Trend analysis (e.g., increase/decrease in incidents over the quarter).

2. **Gather Data:**
   - Navigate to **Reports > Create New** in ServiceNow.
   - Use the following filters in the report configuration:
     - Table: **Incident**
     - Condition: 
       - `Opened on` is on or after the start date of the last quarter.
       - `Opened on` is on or before the end date of the last quarter.
     - Group by: `Priority`
     - Calculate:
       - Count of incidents.
       - Average resolution time (using the `Resolved` and `Opened` fields).

3. **Create the Report:**
   - Choose the report type (e.g., Pie Chart, Bar Chart, or List).
   - Set the report title (e.g., "Incident Trends Report - Last Quarter").
   - Configure visualizations:
     - Pie chart for the distribution of incidents by priority.
     - Bar chart for average resolution times by priority level.

4. **Analyze the Data:**
   - Review the generated report to identify any significant trends:
     - Which priority levels had the most incidents?
     - Were there any priority levels that took significantly longer to resolve?
     - Are there patterns that indicate recurring issues or bottlenecks?

5. **Prepare the Report for Distribution:**
   - Add an executive summary section that highlights key findings and recommendations.
   - Include visual elements (charts, graphs) to enhance readability.
   - Ensure the report is clear and concise for stakeholders.

6. **Schedule and Share the Report:**
   - Set up a schedule for the report to run automatically at the end of each quarter.
   - Configure email notifications to send the report to relevant stakeholders.

7. **Review and Iterate:**
   - Gather feedback from stakeholders on the report's usefulness.
   - Make necessary adjustments for future reports based on feedback.
