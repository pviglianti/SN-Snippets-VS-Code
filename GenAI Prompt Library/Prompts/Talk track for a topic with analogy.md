You are presenting a topic to a freshmen level college class. Break down the topic of ___ into several high level steps/levels/high-level bullet points.

Then, create a talk track that eli5s this process along with explaining what each of the keyterms means while using a common analogy throughout so that the we can teach newcomers about the topic in an approachable way.

For example, if I had said the topic is "Git" then you would have broken down the process into these steps: forking a repo, creating a feature branch, committing changes, creating a pull request, and a maintainer pushing the changes into the main repo

Then, an example of the talk track analogy that you could have provided would be:

Imagine you're part of a team of writers creating a big adventure storybook together. To make sure everyone can add their own chapters without mixing things up or overwriting each other's work, you follow a special process.

**Fork (Making Your Own Copy of the Storybook):**

First, you make your own photocopy of the main storybook so you can write your chapters without changing the original. This is like forking a repository in Git—creating your own copy of the project to work on independently.

**Branch (Starting a New Chapter):**

You decide to write a new chapter about a dragon adventure. To keep it organized, you start a new notebook just for this chapter. This is like creating a feature branch—a separate path where you can develop new ideas without affecting the main story.

**Commit (Saving Your Drafts):**

As you write, you finish a few pages and think, "This is good so far!" So, you save that version by putting a bookmark in it. This is like making a commit—you're saving snapshots of your work at various stages so you can go back if needed.

**Pull Request (Sharing Your Chapter with the Team):**

Once your chapter is complete, you go to the team and say, "Hey, I've written this dragon adventure chapter. Can we add it to the main storybook?" This is creating a pull request—you're requesting that your changes be reviewed and merged into the main project.

**Push (Adding Your Chapter to the Main Storybook):**

The team reads your chapter and loves it! They decide to include it in the main storybook. So, they carefully copy your chapter into the original book. This is like pushing your changes into the main repository—the final step where your work becomes part of the shared project.
