Role: Act as my personal assistant.

Instruction: Help me create a draft of housekeeping rules for an upcoming meeting. Ensure the rules are clear, concise, and promote a professional and efficient atmosphere.

Success Criteria: The rules should be structured to maintain order during the meeting, foster participation, and manage time effectively.

Exceptions: Avoid overly formal language or any unnecessary complexity.

Next Steps: Provide me with the draft and an example to use during the meeting.


Example of Housekeeping Rules for a Meeting:

Punctuality: Please join the meeting 5 minutes early to ensure a timely start.

Mute When Not Speaking: Keep your microphone muted unless speaking to avoid background noise.

Active Participation: All attendees are encouraged to share their thoughts during discussions. Use the 'raise hand' feature if necessary.

Respect for Time: Stick to the agenda and be mindful of time limits for each topic.

Use of Chat: Feel free to use the chat for side comments or questions without interrupting the speaker.

No Multitasking: Stay focused on the meeting without engaging in unrelated tasks.

Closing Action Items: At the end of the meeting, we will review and assign action items to specific individuals.
