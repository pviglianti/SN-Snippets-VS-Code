I need help summarizing a support ticket. Here are the details:

Ticket ID: IT-2024-001234
Title: User unable to access email.
Impact: Affects multiple users across various departments.
Category: IT Support
Assigned Group: IT Helpdesk
Description: Several users have reported issues logging into their email accounts. This problem started this morning around 9 AM, and it seems to be affecting employees from multiple departments, including Sales, Marketing, and Customer Support. Users are receiving error messages stating, 'Access Denied' when they try to log in, and some have reported that their email accounts appear to be locked.
The issue is causing significant disruption to workflow as employees rely heavily on email for communication and accessing essential documents. Additionally, clients are reaching out to the Sales team for updates, but they are unable to respond promptly due to this access issue.
The IT Helpdesk team has already been notified, and they are investigating the matter. However, given the high priority and the number of affected users, immediate attention is needed to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.

Can you provide a concise summary that highlights the key aspects, including the issue, priority, impact, category, and assigned group? I want it to be clear and easy to understand the overall context and urgency of the ticket.
