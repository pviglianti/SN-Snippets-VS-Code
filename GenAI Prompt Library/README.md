This repository is an entry point to submit prompts directly from this GitHub repo, so that they can appear at https://devlink.sn/PromptLibrary

The Prompt Library itself, is a community-driven hub for ServiceNow professionals to gather Generative AI prompts that we use to make our lives easier. **This is not a Now Assist product**. These are prompts we use inside GenAi Service Providers like ChatGPT, Claude Anthropic, or Google Gemini.
