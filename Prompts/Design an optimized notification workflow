Assume the role of an Administrator and design an optimized notification system for incident management in ServiceNow. The goal is to make notifications more relevant, timely, and user-friendly. How would you go, step-by-step, through the process of creating this workflow?

Keep in mind that you will need to develop a process where low-priority incident notifications are consolidated into daily summary emails, and ensure that high-priority incidents trigger immediate notifications to alert relevant teams. Please also outline the following:

1. The key fields to consider when building the workflow (e.g. incident priority, status, user preferences)
2. The appropriate triggers to initiate the notification (e.g. incident creation, priority change, resolution)
3. Conditions to be applied to differentiate notifications for high vs. low-priority incidents
4. Actions to configure for sending notifications (i.e. summary emails, instant alerts, etc.)

Please also provide a final workflow overview, along with best practices or considerations for making this workflow efficient and scalable, while ensuring a smooth user experience.
