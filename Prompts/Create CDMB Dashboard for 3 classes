As a CMDB manager, I want to see a dashboard of CI classes Computer, Server & Router so that my user can see the data in one place,
The dashboard contains the 3 different reports
1 report for Computer, 2nd for Server and 3rd for Router which includes
the fields Name - Class - Creation Date
Sort by Creation Date
